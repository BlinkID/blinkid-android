## BlinkID SDK size report

This SDK size report is for all supported ABIs. We use the Android official [**apkanalyzer**](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apkanalyzer) command line tool to calculate the sizes.

**NOTE**: Presented APK sizes are sums of the `base APK size` + `size of our SDK`. Roughly, the `base APK size` is about `1 MB`, which means that the APK size increase caused by our SDK in your application will be approximately `1 MB` less than presented.

| ABI | APK file size | APK download size |
| --- |:-------------:| :----------------:|
| armeabi-v7a | 7MB | 5.1MB |
| arm64-v8a | 8.1MB | 5.3MB |
| x86 | 9.4MB | 5.8MB |
| x86_64 | 8.6MB | 5.5MB |
