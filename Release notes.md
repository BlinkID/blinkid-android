## v6.8.0

### New Features
- **Glare detection**
	- We’ve introduced glare detection to BlinkID, which removes occlusion on document images caused by glare. You can control the strictness of glare detection with three options (relaxed, normal, and strict) to suit your use case.
	- Real-time feedback during scanning includes a new UI message to help users position the document correctly and reduce glare.
- **Improved blur detection**
	- We’ve raised the threshold for our blur model, making it stricter. This improvement ensures that sharper images are accepted for processing. You can now control the strictness of blur detection with three options (relaxed, normal, and strict).
	- Real-time feedback during scanning includes a new UI message to help users position the document optimally for a clear image.
- **Support for extracting the subtypes of US driver’s licenses & ID cards**
	- BlinkID now extracts precise information about subtypes of driver’s licenses and ID cards (e.g., conditional driver’s license, learner’s permit, provision, enhanced, etc.). This information is included in the scanning results, allowing you to tailor workflows or processes based on document limitations.
- **Classifier improvements**
	- We upgraded our classifier model to prevent double-capturing of the front side of a document, ensuring the front and the back sides are captured correctly. If the back side of a document is not detected, the processing status will return `UnsupportedClass`.
- **Option to anonymize barcode data**
	- You can now anonymize specific fields in the barcode results from an identity document, in addition to the anonymized fields already supported in the Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ).
- **Accessibility and UI improvements**
	- UI has now been improved to work better with a wide range of system font and UI elements sizes.
### Breaking API changes
- Changes to the `BlinkIdSingleSideRecognizer` and `BlinkIdMultiSideRecognizer` settings:
	- renamed `allowBlurFilter` to `enableBlurFilter`
### Minor API changes
- Added a new result member `documentSubtype` in `BlinkIdSingleSideRecognizer.Result`, `BlinkIdMultiSideRecognizer.Result,` and `VIZResult` to include subtype information for US driver’s licenses or ID cards (commercial, provisional, etc.)
- Changes to the `BlinkIdSingleSideRecognizer` and `BlinkIdMultiSideRecognizer` settings:
	- added `enableGlareFilter` which is set to `true` by default
	- added `blurStrictnessLevel` which is set to `Normal` by default (`Strict`, `Normal`, or `Relaxed`)
	- added `glareStrictnessLevel` which is set to `Normal` by default (`Strict`, `Normal`, or `Relaxed`)
- Changes to the `ImageAnalysisResult`:
	- renamed `glare` to `glareDetected`
	- renamed `blurred` to `blurDetected`
- Changes to the `ClassAnonymizationSettings`:
	- `FieldType` array may now be empty when using Builder pattern
#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed data match for Paraguay ID 2023 to cover inconsistencies between the MRZ and Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ)

## v6.7.0

### New Features
- **Real ID symbol detection on US driver's license**
	- BlinkID can now identify Real ID symbols from US driver’s licenses, providing feedback on their presence or absence. This ensures customers can quickly determine if a Real ID symbol is available on a scanned US driver’s license to be compliant with Real ID regulations.
- **UX Improvements**
	- Extended duration for UI messages
		- UI messages now remain visible for a longer time after scanning, improving user experience. Users can now review post-scanning messages at a comfortable pace, leading to a smoother process.
	- Success indicator for front side capture
		- BlinkID now displays a clear success indicator after scanning the front side of a document. This visual cue enhances user confidence by providing immediate feedback during the scanning process.
- **Partial anonymization of the "Document Number"**
	- To ensure user privacy and security, BlinkID now offers the option of partially anonymizing the document number from the scanned document.
- **Mandatory Barcode Presence on US documents**
	- To minimize the cases of capturing the front side of the document as the back frame in the results, BlinkID now requires the presence of a barcode before saving the back frame on US documents. Processing status `BarcodeDetectionFailed` is returned when the mandatory barcode is not present on the back of US documents.

### Minor API changes
- Added `BarcodeDetectionFailed` as a new `ProcessingStatus`
	- This status is triggered once the barcode was not found on the image. This processing status can only occur if the document has the mandatory barcode.
- Added new boolean member `realIdDetectionStatus` to the `ImageAnalysisResult`. If `true`, Real ID symbol is present, `false` otherwise.
- Added new member `documentNumberAnonymizationSettings` to the `ClassAnonymizationSettings` for seamless integration with the document number anonymization feature.
- Deprecated `DocumentScanUISettings`, please use `BlinkIdUISettings`

### Bug Fixes
- Updated internal mapping for Myanmar passports to display nationality as "Myanmarese" instead of "Burmese" on Myanmar passports.
- On Peru ID `Date of Issue` is marked optional, offering customers more flexibility in capturing ID information.
- Improved `Date of Expiry` handling logic for MRZ in cases where documents with a date of expiry year 1969 were not correctly sanitized.
- Fixed Ping server URL error when using `proguard-android-optimize.txt` default proguard file.

## v6.6.1

- fixed URL of the server performing online license check when it's enabled
  - in v9.1.1 the URL depended on the `BUILD_TYPE` property, pointing to production server only when `BUILD_TYPE` was set to `distribute`. However, apparently the `BUILD_TYPE` is not a compile-time property on Android like it's on other platforms and native code, so it was affected by the setting of the app that was integrating the SDK and that caused the SDK to call to a dev server which is unavailable from the external network
- added android.permission.INTERNET permission to the manifest of LibBlinkCard
  - this permission is needed in order to correctly perform license key validation for licenses that require that

## v6.0.0
### New features:
#### Extracting ID data from Arabic and Cyrillic IDs
- When we say you can scan IDs across the globe, we really mean it. Our [list of supported](https://microblink.com/full-list-of-supported-identity-documents/) documents got richer now that we can scan IDs including Arabic and Cyrillic scripts. This fantastic new feature also covers multiscript IDs meaning that we extract data written in both Latin and Arabic data fields.

#### Better barcode scanning and data extraction

- We’ve improved scanning accuracy for all IDs that hold a PDF417 or other barcode types. This means that the error rate is now 20% lower, which brings even cleaner and more reliable data with every scan of an identity document. 

#### New user instructions that lead to successful scans
- More detailed instructions on how to scan identity documents, via an intro tutorial or tooltip during scanning, leading to improved success rates in ID scanning and data extraction.

#### In-depth error messaging for developers
- You asked, we listened! With v6, you’ll get more detailed error messages regarding end-user activity, to better understand if scans should be repeated or accepted.

#### Easier implementation
- Less code, less headaches! You can now implement basic Identity Document Scanning in a single line of code.


### What's new in the BlinkId(Combined) Recognizer?

- Renamed `BlinkIdRecognier` to **BlinkIdSingleSideRecognizer**
- Renamed `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` to **BlinkIdMultiSideRecognizer**
- We introduced new classes: `StringResult`, `DateResult`, and `Date` in order to support multiple alphabets. If a recognizer supports multiple alphabets, its result class (e.g., `BlinkIdMultiSideRecognizer.Result`) will return `StringResult` for results that previously returned `String`.
- Added new result property of an `AdditionalProcessingInfo` type that provides information about `missingMandatoryFields`, `invalidCharacterFields`, and `extraPresentFields`
- Unified `DataMatchResult` and `DataMatchDetailedInfo` into a single structure `DataMatchResult` (removed `dataMatchDetailedInfo` result member)
- Added new result member `cardOrientation` to `ImageAnalysisResult` structure
- More info about transitioning to **BlinkID v6.0.0** can be found in [`Transition guide.md`](Transition guide.md)

## 5.19.0

What's new in the BlinkID(Combined) Recognizer?

### Support for atypical Vietnam passports
- Extract data from Vietnam Passports that have non-ICAO compliant MRZ fields. For example, when the filler arrow is facing the other way (>) instead of the standard way (<)

### Data anonymization
- We've added the option to not extract the religion field on all supported Malaysian documents (MyKad, MyKas, MyKid, MyPR, MyTentera)

### Bugfixes
- Resolved issues with RGB color overlay while extracting document image, which was present on some devices
- Fixed issue with Motorola Moto E40 camera - Camera 2 API wasn’t working

### Minor API breaking change
- We have changed the DirectAPI recognize methods to make it easier to understand which one you should be using. If you want to process:
 - **Still** Android `Bitmaps` (for example, obtained from the gallery), use `recognizeBitmap` or `recognizeBitmapWithRecognizers`.
 - **Video** `Images` that are built from custom camera video frames (for example, when you use your own or third-party camera management), use `recognizeVideoImage` or `recognizeVideoImageWithRecognizers`. Recognition will be optimized for speed and will rely on time-redundancy between consecutive video frames in order to yield the best possible recognition result.
 - **Still** `Images` which are not part of a video stream and you want to get the best possible results from the single `Image` use `recognizeStillImage` or `recognizeStillImageWithRecognizers`. Image type comes from our SDK or it can be created by using ImageBuilder.

## 5.17.0

### New features:
- We've added support for launching the scan activity via the new Activity Result API. Check out our sample to see how to implement it.

### Changes to BlinkID(Combined) Recognizer
- Introduced the expanded DataMatch functionality for the BlinkID with the new result member called `dataMatchDetailedInfo`
	- This result member will enable you to see for which field has been performed, or it did not, the DataMatch functionality. This is enabled for `dateOfBirth`, `documentNumber` and `dateOfExpiry`.
	- For example, if the date of expiry is scanned from the front and back side of the document and values do not match, this method will return DataMatchResult: `Failed`.
Result will be DataMatchResult: `Success` only if scanned values for all fields that are compared are the same. If data matching has not been performed, the result will be DataMatchResult: `NotPerformed`. This information is available for every of the three mentioned field values above.

- Fixed issues with scanning Argentina AlienID, where there were confusions with the regular ID. `ClassInfo` now correctly returns which ID type is present based on the barcode data.

#### Changes to IDBarcodeRecognizer
- For barcodes in countries: Argentina, Colombia, Nigeria, Panama, and South Africa, we now also extract data from the field `Sex` when it's populated with the character "X".

 
### Improvements
- We've added support for Brazil ID Card when the cardholder's face image is rotated for 90 degrees on the document.
	- We will return face image and document image + data from VIZ part present on the back side.
- `SuccessFrameGrabber` setting is now called `saveCameraFrames` and it can return the full frame from the front side now when using BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer, whereas before it returned the full frame only for the back side.

### Changes to BlinkID(Combined) Recognizer

- We've added the parameter `maxAllowedMismatchesPerField` to settings. When this is set to a non-zero value, DataMatch will be successful as long as the number of mismatched characters doesn't exceed the specified value.
- We've added the parameter `allowUncertainFrontSideScan` to settings. When this parameter is set to true, the Recognizer will proceed scanning the back side of the document even if the front side scanning result `State` is `Uncertain`.
- We've enabled the return of image and back side data results, even when the `State` is `Uncertain`. Keep in mind that returned images, in this case, might be blurry or low quality.
	- This applies to all image types: full document image, face and signature image.
- We've added two separate fields for the processing status in the Recognizer Result: `frontProcessingStatus` and `backProcessingStatus`. They indicate the status of the last recognition process for each side.

### Improvements

- Improved quality of fully cropped vertical images
- Better parsing of Bermuda Driving License AAMVA-compliant barcode dates
- Fix for correct calculation of check digit for Saudi Arabia ID Card MRZ
- We are splitting first and last name from the additional name information (e.g., Nom d’ usage, Epouse, Geb. etc.)  into two different results. The additional name info will be a part of the `name_additional_info` field. This applies to the following documents:

	- France
		- ID Card
		- Residence Permit
	- Germany
		- ID Card
	- Luxembourg
		- ID Card
	- Netherlands

		- ID Card
	- Czechia
		- Driving License

	- Document number on Germany Polycarbonate Passport
	- Document number on Hong Kong Polycarbonate Passport
	- Document number and personal ID number on Singapore Polycarbonate Passport

### Breaking change

To optimize our scanning process, we decided to remove support for processors which don't have VFPv4 support because it blocked us from implementing those optimizations.
This affects only a small number of older devices with armeabi_v7 CPUs. Those devices are rarely used.

### Changes to the BlinkId(Combined)Recognizer
- You can now retrieve an image of the document owner along with cropped images of the document itself whenever you’re scanning an AAMVA-compliant ID:

	- Using `BarcodeId` as a `RecognitionMode` lets you scan US driver licenses and IDs that BlinkID can’t read from the Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ) alone. Use it to extract:
		- A face image from the front side
		- Barcode data from the back side
		- Cropped document images of both sides
	- You can disable this `RecognitionMode` by setting `enableBarcodeId` to `false` in the `RecognitionModeFilter`.
- We've improved data extraction through the MRZ:
	- We now allow standard M/F values for gender on Mexican documents (along with localized H/M values)
- We're now converting dates to the Gregorian calendar for:
	- Taiwan documents with Republic of China (ROC) calendar dates
	- Saudi documents with Islamic calendar dates
- We're now auto-filling all ‘partial’ dates found on identity documents (showing year or month-year only):
	- Date of issue will be converted to the first day of the (first) month
		- E.g. '1999' will be converted to '01.01.1999.'
		- E.g. '03.1999.' will be converted to '01.03.1999.'
	- Date of expiry will be converted to the last day of the (last) month
		- E.g. '1999' will be converted to '31.12.1999.'
		- E.g. '03.1999.' will be converted to '31.03.1999.'


## 5.10.0

### Improvements

- **Newly supported identity documents**

    - Saudi Arabia - DL (front)
    - Saudi Arabia - Resident ID (front)

- We've introduced another variant of `resetRecognitionState` method that lets you reset the scanning process in different recognition stages:
- If you’re using our Direct API, call `RecognizerRunner.resetRecognitionState(false)` to clear the scanning cache as well as results gathered in a specific recognition step, i.e. after scanning the back side of a document.
- If you’re using our built-in UI to scan IDs from the camera stream, call `RecognizerRunnerView.resetRecognitionState(false)` to do the same.

### Changes to the BlinkId(Combined)Recognizer:

- We're now able to extract the additional address on Hungary Address Cards
- We've improved data extraction through the MRZ:
    - We now return the document type through `ClassInfo`, regardless of the `RecognitionMode` you're using (`MrzId`, `MrzPassport` or `MrzVisa`).
    - This means you can now use `ClassFilter` to filter these documents by their type.
    - We now return the document number on Nigeria IDs complete with its check digit.
    - We now support Italy Residence Permits with a *CR* document code.
- We've extended the `ClassInfo` structure with helper methods so you can filter documents by country more easily:
    - Use `countryName`, `isoNumericCountryCode`, `isoAlpha2CountryCode` and `isoAlpha3CountryCode` to get the full country names or their representative codes defined by [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes).
- We've extended the `BarcodeResult` structure with `extendedElements`
    - You can find all data from AAMVA-compliant barcodes under their respective `BarcodeElementKey` in the `BarcodeElements` structure
    - For a full list of keys please see `BarcodeElementKey` enum
- We've added another `ProcessingStatus` called `AwaitingOtherSide`
    - This status is triggered once BlinkID has finished with the first side of a document and expects the other side, too.
- We're now able to extract the date of birth from the CURP field on Mexico Voter IDs
- Direct API:
	- We've added a new recognition mode for recognizing still images of documents that have already been cropped:
		- Set the `scanCroppedDocumentImage` to true when you're feeding BlinkID images of documents that have already been cropped and don't require detection.
		- Keep in mind that this setting won't work on document images that haven't been properly cropped.


### Changes to the IdBarcodeRecognizer:

- We've extended the results with `extendedElements`
    - You can find all data from AAMVA-compliant barcodes under their respective `BarcodeElementKey` in the `BarcodeElements` structure
    - For a full list of keys please see `BarcodeElementKey` enum

### Deprecated recognizers:

-  We've deprecated `UsdlRecognizer`. Please use `IdBarcodeRecognizer` instead.

### Minor API changes

- We've replaced `Using time-limited license!` warning with `Using trial license!` warning. The warning message is displayed when using a trial license key.
- We’ve renamed `MrtdDocumentType.MRTD_TYPE_IDENITY_CARD` enum member to `MrtdDocumentType.MRTD_TYPE_IDENTITY_CARD`.

### Fixes:

- We've fixed the front-facing camera error on `Oukitel WP8 Pro`.
- We've fixed a rare crash in `BlinkIdOverlayController`, which happened as a result of rapidly launching the scanning process multiple times in a row.

## 5.9.0

### New features:
- We’ve updated SDK's Android **target API level to 30**.
- We’ve translated the complete SDK to the **Serbian** language.
- We’ve  made the SDK safe from **tapjacking**, a form of attack where a user is tricked into tapping something he or she didn’t intend to tap. We did this by adding a new security option that prompts the SDK to discard touches when the activity's window is obscured by another visible window. To activate it, use `UISettings.setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(true)`.
- We’ve added a new feedback message to users, reminding them to keep a document fully visible in case they accidentally cover a part of it with their finger or an object.
    - It appears while scanning the document by using `BlinkIdUISettings` and `BlinkIdOverlayController`:
    - It will display an error message "Keep the document fully visible".
    - This message is displayed only when using `BlinkIdRecognizer` or `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` for scanning.
- We’ve introduced a new `FrameRecognitionCallback` callback for the `RecognizerRunnerView`, which is invoked each time a camera frame from a video stream is recognized. Use `RecognizerRunnerView.setFrameRecognitionCallback` method to set the callback.

### New features and updates to the `BlinkIdRecognizer` and `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer`

- We’re now able to read partial MRZ formats (2.5 lines), like the ones found on Switzerland and Liechtenstein DLs.
- We’ve added `documentOptionalAdditionalNumber` to the main part of the result, as well as front and back side VIZ results.
- We’ve expanded the set of possible recognizer states with `StageValid`. This state fixes `BlinkIDCombinedRecognizer` timeout issues, and enables better control of the Combined scanning pipeline. It activates when the first side of a document has been successfully scanned and scanning of the second side is required.

### Fixes

- We’ve fixed an uncommon bug where you’d get incomplete results upon scanning of the MRZ with the `allowUnparsed` setting enabled.
- SDK does not require permission `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` to unlock itself anymore, in cases when the license key needs online activation.


## 5.8.0

### New features:

* We added user feedback when turning ON the flashlight on `BlinkIdOverlayController`:
	* It warns the user to watch out for flashlight glare.
	* It can be disabled by using `BlinkIdUISettings.setShowFlashlightWarning(false)` option.

### New additions to our supported documents list

### Other features and updates

* We added the field `middleName` to `BlinkId(Combined)Recognizer`, `IdBarcodeRecognizer` and `Usdl(Combined)Recognizer` results. This field is extracted from AAMVA standard compliant barcodes, whenever available.

### Deprecated recognizers

We have deprecated the following recognizers:

- `PassportRecognizer`, `VisaRecognizer` - **use `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` or `BlinkIdRecognizer` instead**

- `DocumentFaceRecognizer`, `MrtdRecognizer` - **use `BlinkIdRecognizer` instead**

- `MrtdCombinedRecognizer` - **use `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` instead**

- `UsdlRecognizer` - **use `IdBarcodeRecognizer` instead**

### Major API change

`ScanResultListener` interface now has an additional method called when the scanning cannot continue because of an unrecoverable error. You have to implement `onUnrecoverableError` method.
If you’re using built-in activities, when `onActivityResult` is called with `RESULT_CANCELED` result code, the exception will be available via `ActivityRunner.EXTRA_SCAN_EXCEPTION` intent extra. If the user canceled the scan, the exception would be `null`.

### Fixes

* We improved the data match logic for **Guatemala Consular ID** in BlinkId(Combined)Recognizer.
* We fixed race conditions in camera management, which in some cases caused that the camera was unable to resume after it has been paused.

## 5.7.0

## New features
- We translated complete SDK to the following additional languages: **Malay**, **Dutch**, **Hungarian**, **Slovenian**, **Indonesian**, **Arabic(UAE)**, **Romanian**, **Chinese traditional**, **Chinese simplified**, **Thai**, **Hebrew**, **Vietnamese**, **Filipino**.

## Improvements to existing features:

- We have improved parsing of **MRZ** formats deviating from the ISO/IEC 7501 standard:
	- Document discriminator was in place of the document number on driver licenses and IDs from:
		- **New York**
		- **Michigan**
		- **Canada**
	- Different check digit calculation for **Mexico** (Consular) ID
	- Recognition of the unofficial `XCT` country code for Northern **Cyprus** ID
	- Recognition of different country codes and check digit calculation on **China** Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents
- We added **anonymization** support for:
	- MRZ on the Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents
- We have made some changes to the **BlinkID(Combined)Recognizer**
	- You can now see `ProcessingStatus` in the results to inspect potential processing errors, such as when barcode detection fails, a mandatory field is missing, etc.
	- You can now also see a more detailed `ImageAnalysisResult` showing you when:
		- Face image is detected
		- MRZ is detected
		- Barcode is detected
	- We added a `RecognitionModeFilter` settings group. You can toggle flags on this object to control the recognition mode of the recognizer:
		- `enableMrzId` lets you scan MRZ on all identity documents except visas and passports.
		- `enableMrzVisa` lets you scan MRZ on visa documents.
		- `enableMrzPassport` lets you scan MRZ on passports.
		- `enablePhotoId` lets you scan photo IDs. Use it to enable or disable document and face image extraction on unsupported documents.
		- `enableFullRecognition` lets you scan all data from our [supported](https://github.com/BlinkID/blinkid-android/blob/master/documentation/BlinkIDRecognizer.md) documents.
		- Your license key still controls which of the above recognition modes are allowed.
	- We have added a `RecognitionMode` result member describing which recognition mode was used to produce the results.
	-  We are now retrieving sex and nationality fields from the MRZ in cases where those two fields cannot be found in the document’s VIZ. Previously, we only used to do this for dates, name fields and document numbers.
	- We are now preserving the original string (raw data) of the dates we couldn’t parse.
- We have improved the thresholds for card detection feedback messages ("move closer" and "move farther"). This will improve the UX when scanning in landscape mode as the document can now be closer to the camera.

## Minor API Changes
- We have made some changes to the `BlinkIDRecognizer` and `BlinkIDCombinedRecognizer`:
	- We renamed `DocumentImageMoireStatus` to `ImageAnalysisDetectionStatus`
	- We grouped the `conditions` member from the results with the `DriverLicenseDetailedInfo` structure
- We renamed `RecogitionMode` to `RecognitionDebugMode` in `RecognizerBundle`.

## Bug fixes:
- We fixed an issue in default UI that was causing reticle to reappear while card flip animation was showing.
- We fixed [Issue #220](https://github.com/BlinkID/blinkid-android/issues/220)  - methods marked with `@NonNull` no longer return `null`.

## 5.6.0

### New features:

- In `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` and `BlinkIdRecognizer` we added:
    - Support for US documents with **vertical** orientations:
        - Alabama DL

        - South Carolina DL
        - Tennessee DL
        - Texas DL
        - Utah DL
        - Washington DL
        - Wisconsin DL
    - Support for **new document types**:
        - Croatia Health Insurance Card / front side / BETA
        - Ecuador ID / front side
        - El Salvador ID / BETA
        - Sri Lanka ID / BETA
    - No longer BETA:
        - Canada Nova Scotia DL
        - Canada Yukon DL
        - Norway DL
    - Back side support:
        - Kenya ID
    - **Result anonymization** - with this option enabled, results are not returned for protected fields on documents listed here. The full document image will also have this data blacked out.
        - Protected fields are:
             - Document number on Hong Kong ID
             - MRZ on Hong Kong passports
             - Personal ID number on Netherlands DL
             - Personal ID number and MRZ on Netherlands ID
             - MRZ on Netherlands passports
             - Document number on Singapore DL, ID, Fin Card, Resident ID
             - Personal ID number on Singapore Employment Pass
             - Document number and personal ID number on Singapore Work Permit
             - MRZ on Singapore passports.
        - By using `setAnonymizationMode` method, you can choose the `AnonymizationMode` : `ImageOnly`, `ResultFieldsOnly`, `FullResult` or `None`.
        - `FullResult` anonymization (both images and data) is set by default.

- We added support for new **MRZ** formats:
    - Guatemala ID
    - Kenya ID

### Improvements to existing features:

- We updated `UsdlRecognizer.Result` and `IdBarcodeRecognizer.Result` with additional address fields:
    - `street`, `postalCode`, `city` and `jurisdiction`
- We added `isExpired()` method to `BlinkIdRecognizer.Result`, `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer.Result` and `IdBarcodeRecognizer.Result`.
    - It compares the current time on the device with the date of expiry and checks whether the document has expired or not.
- We made changes to the result structure of `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` and `BlinkIdRecognizer`:
    - Barcode data is now encapsulated in its own result structure: `BarcodeResult`.
    - Data from all OCR-ed fields, without MRZ data, is now encapsulated in a `VizResult` structure, representing the "Visual Inspection Zone" data. In `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer`, front side data is available in its own structure (`frontVizResult`), back side data in its own (`backVizResult`), so you can now **access data from each side separately**.
    - The main part of the result, outside these structures, is filled according to these rules:
        - Document number is filled with data from the MRZ, if present.
        - Remaining data is then filled with barcode data.
        - Remaining data is filled from the back side's visual inspection zone (OCR data outside of MRZ).
        - Remaining data is filled from the front side's visual inspection zone.
        - Remaining data is filled with data from the MRZ.

### Minor API changes:

- We moved `BlinkIdRecognizer.Result` members `colorStatus` and `moireStatus` to the result's `imageAnalysisResult` (`frontImageAnalysisResult` and `backImageAnalysisResult` in `BlinkIDCombinedRecognizer.Result`).
- We changed default `IntentDataTransferMode` to `IntentDataTransferMode.PERSISTED_OPTIMISED`. It can be configured by using `MicroblinkSDK.setIntentDataTransferMode`.

### Bug fixes:

- We fixed US driver's license address extraction (Oregon, Mississippi, Rhode Island).
- We fixed a bug which caused that, in some cases, camera has not been resumed after the device screen was turned OFF and back ON.


## 5.5.0

- In `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` and `BlinkIdRecognizer` we added:
	- Support for obtaining full document image for IDs with barcodes. Now you can capture document image and extract barcode data with a single scan.
	- Scanning & data extraction for  travel visas and passports.
	- Field validation - we validate if the results from certain fields match predefined character sets.
			- If validation fails, the recognizer's state is `Recognizer.Result.State.Uncertain`.
			- Use `setValidateResultCharacters()`to enable or disable validation.
	- Field anonymization for sensitive data.
			- Enable or disable whether certain sensitive data should be anonymized in full document image result.
			- Use `setAnonymizeImage()` to enable or disable image anonymization.

	- Barcode scanning on the following documents:
		- Argentina ID
		- Colombia ID
		- Nigeria Voter ID
		- South Africa ID

### Improvements for existing features:

- Improvements in `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` and `BlinkIdRecognizer`:
	- Documents discarded with the class filter are now reported as not supported
		-  `ClassifierCallback.onDocumentSupportStatus(false)` will be called if a documents is filtered out by the `ClassFilter`
	- For Malaysian MyKad we are now returning if a Moire pattern is present on the scanned document (detected or not detected).
		- use `getDocumentImageMoireStatus()` in `BlinkIdRecognizer`.
		- use `getDocumentFrontImageMoireStatus()` and `getDocumentBackImageMoireStatus()` in `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer `.
- We added digital signature support to `PassportRecognizer`.
- We updated `IdBarcodeRecognizer.Result` with specific driving license info.
	- Use `getRestrictions()`, `getEndorsements()` and `getVehicleClass()`.
- We enabled usage of combined recognizers through the Direct API:
    - Recognition state is not automatically reset with every image that comes to the recognition through the Direct API. If reset is required, you should call `RecognizerRunner.resetRecognitionState()`

### Bug fixes:

- We fixed bug in `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` and `BlinkIdRecognizer` which caused that dates on Belgian ID cards are not parsed correctly in cases when month is July.


## 5.4.0

### Breaking change:

Based on the feedback, we have restored support for **x86_64** processor architecture. Due to the architecture specifics, there is no guarantee that the scanning process will work equally well as it does on the ARM architectures. The main reason for restoring support is to ease the compliance issue for developers.
We distribute SDK with **ARMv7**, **ARM64**, **x86**, and **x86_64** native library binaries.

### New features:

- We added age verification feature:
    - Now you can more easily obtain the age of the document owner in years and check whether it is above some age limit.
    - Use `age` and `ageLimitStatus` helper methods in `MrzResult`, `BlinkIdRecognizer.Result`, `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer.Result`, `UsdlRecognizer.Result`, `UsdlCombinedRecognizer.Result`, and `IdBarcodeRecognizer.Result`.

### Improvements:

- We have translated complete SDK to following languages: **Croatian**, **Czech**, **English**, **French**, **German**, **Italian**, **Portuguese**, **Slovak**, and **Spanish**.

- We added support for new document types in `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` and `BlinkIdRecognizer`:

    - Australia - Australian Capital Territory - Driving licence / front only
    - Australia - Northern Territory - Driving licence / BETA
    - Australia - Tasmania - Driving licence / front only / BETA
    - Canada - Alberta - ID card / BETA
    - Canada - British Columbia - Driver license / Public services card (Combined)
    - Canada - British Columbia - ID card / BETA
    - Canada - British Columbia - Public services card
    - Canada - New Brunswick - Driving license
    - Canada - Nova Scotia - Driving license / BETA
    - Canada - Yukon - Driving license / BETA
    - Panama - Driving license / front only / BETA
    - Panama - ID card / front only
    - Singapore - Work permit / BETA
    - Taiwan - ID card / front only / BETA
    - USA - Alabama - ID card
    - USA - Alaska - ID card / BETA
    - USA - District Of Columbia - Driver license / BETA
    - USA - Idaho - ID card / BETA
    - USA - Indiana - ID card / BETA
    - USA - Kentucky - ID card / BETA
    - USA - Massachusetts - ID card
    - USA - Oregon - ID card
    - USA - Washington - ID card
    - We added support for back side to:
        - Australia - Western Australia - Driving licence
        - Mexico - Voter ID
        - Netherlands - Driving licence
- Additional improvements in `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` and `BlinkIdRecognizer`:
    - When the back side of the document is not fully supported by the `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer`, we will capture and return the back side image without performing data extraction. You can disable this behaviour by using `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer.setSkipUnsupportedBack(true)`.
    - We are now returning color status for the scanned document (black and white or color) in the following result fields:
        - `documentImageColorStatus` in `BlinkIdRecognizer.Result`.
        - `documentFrontImageColorStatus` and `documentBackImageColorStatus` in `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer.Result`.
    - We are now returning `ClassInfo` which holds the following information about the scanned document: `Country`, `Region`, and `Type` of the document. Use  `BlinkIdRecognizer.Result.getClassInfo()` and `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer.Result.getClassInfo()`.
    - We introduced `ClassFilter` which determines whether a document should be processed or is filtered out, based on its `ClassInfo`. Use  `BlinkIdRecognizer.setClassFilter` and `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer.setClassFilter` to enable it.
    - To improve the scanning performance, we added additional feedback for users that ensures a detected document is entirely inside the frame. When a document is too close to the edge of the camera frame, we will display an appropriate message to the user in `BlinkIdOverlayController`. You can configure the minimum distance from the edge of the frame by using the `paddingEdge` settings method.

- Improvements in `BlinkIdOverlayController`:
    - When a document is too close to the edge of the camera frame, we display *`Move the document from the edge`* message.
    - We added better user instructions when barcodes are being scanned in `UsdlCombinedRecognizer`. We display *`Scan the barcode`* message.
- We are now delivering the complete list of open source dependencies used in the SDK. Please check the `open-source-software-used` directory.

### Minor API changes:

- We removed `RecognizerRunnerView` custom attributes: `mb_initialOrientation` and `mb_aspectMode`. Use `RecognizerRunnerView.setInitialOrientation` and `RecognizerRunnerView.setAspectMode` to configure the attributes in the code.

### Bug fixes:

- We fixed bug in `BlinkIdOverlayController` which caused that `MrtdRecognizer.Result` is cleared after scanning is done and empty result is returned.

## 5.3.0

### Breaking change:

We decided to remove support for **x86_64** processor architecture.
 **x86** and **x86_64** architectures are used on very few devices today; most of them are manufactured before 2015 and they take about 1% of all Android devices, according to the device catalog on Google Play Console.
We distribute SDK with **ARMv7**, **ARM64**, and **x86** native library binaries. Native library x86 in SDK is kept mainly for emulator support.

### New features:

- We added a new recognizer specialized for scanning and parsing barcodes on various identity cards - `IdBarcodeRecognizer`.  Supported document types are:
    - AAMVA compliant (US DL, Canada DL, etc.)
    - Argentina ID
    - Panama ID
    - Colombia ID
    - South Africa ID
    - Nigeria Voter ID and driver license

- We added the option to disable Microblink logs in the console output. Use `LoggingSettings.disableMicroblinkLogging()`. Be careful with this option. We need full log outputs from the application for support purposes. In case of having problems with scanning certain items, undesired behavior on the specific device(s), crashes inside SDK or anything unmentioned, we will need a full log from your side. If you disable Microblink logging, you won't be able to provide us this information. Hence support might be limited.

### Improvements for existing features:

- We added new result fields in `MrzResult`, returned by all recognizers which scan MRZ (Machine Readable Zone):
    - `issuerName`
    - `nationalityName`
- Improvements in `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` and `BlinkIdRecognizer`:
    - new recognizer options: `allowUnparsedMrzResults` and `allowUnverifiedMrzResults`
    - new result field: `dateOfExpiryPermanent`
    - support for 14 new document types: `South Australia DL`, `Bosnia and Herzegovina DL`, `Canada Ontario ID`, `Costa Rica DL`, `Denmark DL`, `Estonia DL`, `Finland DL`, `Kenya ID`, `Lithuania DL`, `Malaysia MyPR`, `Malta DL`, `Mexico Consular ID`, `Nigeria Voter ID`, `Philippines Professional ID`
    - improved support for: `USA Hawaii DL`, `Colombia DL`, `Costa Rica ID`, `France ID`, `India ID`, `Kazakhstan ID`, `Kuwait Resident ID`, `Israel DL`, `Kuwait DL`, `Thailand ID`

### Minor API changes:

- `CameraPermissionManager` constructor accepts object of type `CameraPermissionManager.ResourceIds` as a second parameter which can be used to customise "ask permission" layout - for previously used layout, use default implementation `com.microblink.hardware.camera.CameraPermissionManagerResources`
- `RecognizerRunnerFragment` extends `androidx.fragment.app.Fragment`, instead of deprecated `android.app.Fragment`
- All provided scan activities extend `AppCompatActivity`

### Bug fixes:

- We fixed crash when using Direct API on high resolution `com.microblink.image.Image` from `HighResImageWrapper`


## 5.2.0

### Improvements:

- **overall size impact on application reduced for almost 30%** when BlinkID SDK v5.2 is used, relative to size impact of the previous v5.1
- enabled setting `MrzFilter` on `MrtdCombinedRecognizer`:
    - determines whether document should be processed or it is filtered out, based on its MRZ (Machine Readable Zone)
    - this feature is also available for `MrtdRecognizer`
-  added Canada Alberta DL support for `BlinkIdRecognizer` and `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer`
- enabled scanning back sides of 6 documents with `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer`:
    - Czechia ID
    - Egypt ID
    - Germany ID
    - Italy ID
    - Pakistan Consular ID
    - Pakistan ID
- added property `localizedName` to `BlinkIdRecognizer.Result` and `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer.Result` (CCC to Chinese alphabet conversion for Hong Kong ID)
- enabled digital signing of `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer.Result`
- improved camera performance on some Samsung devices

### Minor API changes:

- `MrzFilter` now accepts `MrzResult` for filtering, previously filtering has been performed based on the given `MrtdRecognizer` result.
- `RecognizerRunner.getSingletonInstance()` does not throw `FeatureNotSupportedException` anymore

### Bug fixes:

- `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` - fixed issue when the front side of a document was returned as a back side

## 5.1.0

### New features:

- added 38 new documents for `BlinkIdRecognizer` and `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer`: Algeria ID, Argentina DL, Australia Victoria DL, Australia Queensland DL, Australia Western Australia DL, Belgium Resident ID, Canada British Columbia DL, Canada Ontario DL, Canada Quebec DL, Cyprus ID, Czechia DL, Czechia ID, Egypt ID, Greece DL, India ID, India Pan Card, Israel DL, Malaysia MyKid, Malaysia MyTentera, Maldives ID, Morocco ID, Nigeria DL, Paraguay ID, Portugal DL, Puerto Rico DL, Qatar DL, Russia DL, Singapore Fin Card, Singapore Resident ID, Slovakia DL, Slovenia DL, South Africa DL, South Africa ID, Thailand ID, Tunisia ID, UAE DL, Uganda ID and Vietnam ID.

- added new fields in `MrzResult`:
    - `sanitizedDocumentCode`
    - `sanitizedDocumentNumber`
- improved `BlinkIdRecognizer` and `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer`:
    - introduced blur filter that discards blurred frames and prevents reading data from them. This option is enabled by default, it can be disabled by using `BlinkIdRecognizer.setAllowBlurFilter(false)` and `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer.setAllowBlurFilter(false)`

## 5.0.1

### New features:

- new options in `BlinkIdUISettings`, `DocumentUISettings`, `DocumentVerificationUISettings` and `BlinkIdOverlaySettings`:
    - option to disable displaying of "Document Not Supported" dialog when `BlinkIdRecognizer` or `BlinkIdCombinedRecognizer` is used in combination with other recognizers - use method `setShowNotSupportedDialog`
    - option to configure back side scanning timeout - use `setBackSideScanningTimeoutMs`
- it is possible to set theme that will be used by activity launched from the UISettings - use UISettings.setActivityTheme

### Minor API changes:
- all scan activity classes are final now

### Bug fixes:
- fixed problems with aspect ratio of camera preview on Huawei Mate 10

## 5.0.0

### **BlinkID v5 Release Announcement**

We are very proud to announce BlinkID v5, the latest upgrade of our most popular product. BlinkID v5 is our first product powered entirely by machine learning.

#### Highlights in the BlinkID v5 Release

BlinkID v5 introduces improvements in the speed and accuracy of scanning and data extraction, and you will find:

- Best-in-class card detection.
- Automatic classification of different document types (no need to preselect the country or document type).
- Innovative and seamless UX with real-time instructions for the users.
- Data matching – we match the expiry date, DOB, date of issue, and document number captured from the front side with the data from the barcode or MRZ on the back.

Besides the new features listed above, we have worked on the improved performance of several other document components:

- Scanning of all documents with MRZ (IDs, passports, travel visas), or PDF417 barcodes.
- Scanning and data extraction of the front side of US driver’s licenses and IDs (horizontal).
- Capturing cropped face image supported even on vertical documents, passports and travel visas.
- Capturing document image.

#### Integration improvements

One of the main benefits that BlinkID v5 will bring is scalability and faster support for new document types.

- The integration of the mobile SDK will be significantly easier and faster.
- Mobile SDK build size will be much smaller.

#### How to get started and plan your upgrade?

BlinkID v5 mobile SDK release is currently available for native platforms.

- It’s advisable to get familiar with the range of supported document types. We will keep adding support for new documents and regularly update [the list on Github](https://github.com/BlinkID/blinkid-android/blob/master/documentation/BlinkIDRecognizer.md).
- If currently supported document types are not yet supported in BlinkID v5 please follow future releases.
- To upgrade to BlinkID v5, you will need to obtain a new license key specifically for the document types that you require.
- Already licensed production keys will continue to work as usual, until you decide to upgrade.
- What if you require document types supported in the previous version (and not yet added in BlinkID v5) and another document type supported in BlinkID v5? That’s manageable, and in that case, we will create a custom build for you.

We strongly recommend checking the [list of supported document types](https://github.com/BlinkID/blinkid-android/blob/master/documentation/BlinkIDRecognizer.md) regularly. Please star and watch this repository, and take the time to test BlinkID v5 as much as possible.

Your opinion, especially on the performance and redesigned UX is very important for future developments. We would appreciate your feedback at blinkid@microblink.com.

## 4.8.0

**Important notice on MRTD recognizer in the latest BlinkID SDK release (v4.8.0)**

Please note that we have significantly improved accuracy for MRZ/MRTD scanning because now we switched to the newest OCR technology based on machine learning.
To be more precise, we measured and compared existing vs. new MRTD scanning. The new OCR system based on machine learning achieves 99.9% accuracy on the character level, which results with a 50% reduction in the error rate in MRZ extraction.

In order to use new *MrtdRecognizer* or *MrtdCombinedRecognizer* or to continue using any additional *Recognizer for scanning any ID with the MRZ (machine readable zone)* within the latest BlinkID SDK update, you *must* have a new license key. Before updating to the SDK version 4.8.0, please contact your account manager or send an email to support@microblink.com to obtain the *new production license key*.

**Important notes**:

- The MRTD scanning with the older BlinkID SDK versions (v4.7.0 and below) will continue to work without any problems - until you decide to update.
- If you upgrade to the SDK version 4.8.0 without a new license key scanning of MRTD/MRZ documents will not work.
- Contact us at support@microblink.com to obtain a new license key if you plan to update your app with the latest release.

For any questions, you might have, we stand at your service.

	- affects code where character whitelist is defined through `BlinkOCREngineOptions` for used parsers (e.g. `Templating API`)

## 3.10.0

### New features:

- added support for scanning Austrian passports - use `AustrianPassportRecognizerSettings`

	- default engine options returned by method `getOcrEngineOptions` for both parser settings return instance of `BlinkOCREngineOptions`

### Improvements for existing features

- improved address parsing on Malaysian iKad documents
	- affects only iKad recognizer (represented by `IKadRecognizerSettings`)

	- affects:
		- Croatian ID front recognizer (represented by `CroatianIDFrontSideRecognizerSettings`) - date of expiry is keyword **TRAJNO**
		- Croatian ID back recognizer (represented by `CroatianIDBackSideRecognizerSettings`) - date of expiry inside MRZ is `991231`
		- Croatian ID combined recognizer (represented by `CroatianIDCombinedRecognizerSettings`)

### Bug fixes:

- fixed occassional crash in MRTD detection algorithm
	- this affects both _MRTD Recognizer_ (represented by `MRTDRecognizerSettings`) and _MRTD Detector_ (represented by `MRTDDetectorSettings`)


## 3.9.0

- bugfix in Croatian ID scanning:
    - ensured that OIB number is not returned for old ID cards, where it does not exist
- added Czech and Slovak translations
- Date fields in recognition results are returned as `com.microblink.results.date.Date` class which represents immutable dates that are consisted of day, month and year
- improved `IbanParser`:
    - improved extraction of IBANs without prefix and introduced `setAlwaysReturnPrefix` option to always return prefix (country code)
    - added support for french IBANs
- enabled reading of Pdf417 barcodes having width/height bar aspect ratio less than 2:1
- Added `VinRecognizer` for scanning VIN (*Vehicle Identification Number*) barcodes
- Added unified `BarcodeRecognizer` for scanning various tipes of barcodes
    - `ZXingRecognizer`, `BarDecoderRecognizer` and `AztecRecognizer` are **deprecated**, `BarcodeRecognizer` should be used for all barcode types that are supported by these recognizers
- `OcrLine.getChars()` method returns `CharWithVariants` array. OCR char is defined by all its parameters (value, font, position, quality, etc.) and for each resulting char it is possible to have multiple variants. For example it is possible to have same char value with different font.
- Fixed bug in SegmentScanActivity:
    - scan results are no longer hidden on shake event
- improved `IKadRecognizer`:
    - added support for long addresses and employer names
    - fixed returning of full document images as metadata
- improved `Singapore ID Recognizers`:
    - tuned reading positions

    - better handling of names containing dashes and extra long names
- improved `TopUpParser`:
    - added option to return USSD code without prefix
- by default `MRTDRecognizer` does not return results with incorrect check digits

## 3.8.0

- introduced ability to create minimum-size AAR
	- a separate static library distribution now exists which contains a script that you can configure with features you need and it creates a AAR file which only contains features you need - this includes minimum-size native binary and only required assets. The rest (resources and java classes) can be thrown-away by ProGuard.
- `LibBlinkID` is now fully ProGuard-compatible, i.e. you no longer need to exclude `com.microblink.**` classes in your ProGuard configuration
- removed support for Android 2.3 and Android 4.0 - minimum required Android version is now Android 4.1 (API level 16)
	- devices with Android 4.0 and earlier take [less than 2% of market share](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html#Platform) and is very costly to support them
- removed `isItalic` and `isBold` getters from `OcrChar` class
    - they always returned `false`, since OCR engine cannot accurately detect that
- removed `setLineGroupingEnabled` and `isLineGroupingEnabled` from `BlinkOCREngineOptions` because disabling line grouping completely destroyed the OCR accuracy
- added `GermanIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the German ID

## 3.7.1

    - `CameraViewGroup`: renamed animateRotation to `mb_animateRotation`, animationDuration to `mb_animationDuration`, rotatable to `mb_rotatable`
    - `BaseCameraView`:  renamed initialOrientation to `mb_initialOrientation`, aspectMode to `mb_aspectMode`
- improved `MRTDRecognizer`:
    - WSA (World Goverment of World Citizens) added as valid country code when parsing MRZ
- added `USDLCombinedRecognizer`: scans face image and USDL barcode

## 3.7.0

- updated German ID recognizers:
    - instead of `GermanIDMRZSideRecognizer`, which was used for scanning front side of the older ID cards and back side of the new ID cards, there are two specialised recognizers:  `GermanIDBackSideRecognizer`  and `GermanOldIDRecognizer`
    - improved scanning accuracy of the `GermanIDFrontSideRecognizer` (name and surname)
    - splitting address from back side of the new German ID (GermanIDBackSideRecognizer) to ZIP code, city, street and house number

- better support for German passports: `GermanPassportRecognizer` reads passport data from MRZ and fields outside of the MRZ

- splitting address in `MyKadRecognizer` to street, ZIP code, city and state

- improved Croatian ID recognizers:
    - multiple scans are used for better confidence

- `TopUpParser` improvements

- `DateParser` can parse dates with month names in English (either full or abbreviated), if this option is enabled

- added support for polish IBAN without PL prefix to `IBANParser`

- fixed returning of images inside TemplatingAPI for frames when document was not correctly detected

    - `AustrianIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Austrian ID
    - `CroatianIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Croatian ID
    - `CzechIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Czech ID
    - `MRTDCombinedRecognizer`: scans face image from any type of the document and Machine Readable Zone
    - `SerbianIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Serbian ID
    - `SingaporeIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Singapore ID
    - `SlovakIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Slovak ID
    - `SlovenianIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Slovenian ID

    Combined recognizers can be used for scanning multiple parts/sides of the document in predefined order. They combine results from individual scans to boost accuracy and merge them into the final result.

- added `VerificationFlowActivity` which is designed for scanning multiple parts/sides of the document by using provided combined recognizers

- optimised native binary size
    - 15% size reduction for `arm64-v8a` ABI
    - 14% size reduction for `x86` ABI
    - 13% size reduction for `armeabi-v7a` and `x86_64 ABIs

    - by using method `setAllowUnverifiedResults` in `MRTDRecognizerSettings`,  it is possible to allow obtaining of results with incorrect check digits
- Singapore ID recognizer is split in two recognizers - one for front and one for back side
- added Belgian account number check to IBAN parser
- added support for Android 7 multi-window mode
- fixed autofocus bug on Huawei Honor 8
- fixed black camera on Motorola Moto Z
- made camera focusing more stable on some devices
    - _stable_ means less "jumpy" when searching for focused image
- added support for receiving of `GlareMetadata` which informs user that there is too much glare for performing recognition of ID document

## 3.3.0

- removed `RecognizerView` method `setInitialScanningPaused`. For achieving the same functionality, method `pauseScanning` should be used.
- added support for scanning IBANs that contain spaces and dashes

## 2.6.0
- added support for templating API
	- templating API gives you possiblity to combine various detectors with parsers and thus create your own recognizer that can recognize any type of document
	- check updated `BlinkID` demo app for example of how templating API could be used to scan both front and rear side of croatian ID cards
- updated `BlinkOCRActivity`:
	- `ScanConfiguration` can now define following new features:
		- whether this configuration is required or optional
		- size of field displayed
- added support for scanning North Carolina driver license barcodes
- added support for following MRZ codes:
	- austrian ID
	- kuwait ID
	- pakistani ID
- added recognizers specialized for scanning front and back side of Croatian ID cards
	- although this can be achieved using templating API, we also added dedicated recognizers for convenience

- added support for scanning german driver licences
    - this is achieved by renaming UKDL recognizer to EUDL recognizer which now supports
      both UK driver's licences and german driver's licences
    - this recognizer will be expanded in future with support for other DL's from European contries
- fixed bug on some devices causing it to never start scanning if device was not shaken

## 2.0.0
- new API which is easier to understand, but is not backward compatible. Please check [README](README.md) and updated demo applications for more information.
- removed support for ARMv7 devices which do not support NEON SIMD
	- this enabled us to increase recognition speed at cost of not supporting old devices like those using NVIDIA Tegra 2
	- you can check [this article](https://microblink.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206113151-Removing-support-for-devices-without-NEON-SIMD-extensions) for more information about NEON and why we use it
- added official support for Android 6.0 and it's runtime camera permissions
	- if using provided activities, the logic behind asking user to give camera permission is handled internally
	- if integrating using custom UI, you are required to ask user to give you permission to use camera. To make this easier, we have provided a _CameraPermissionManager_ class which does all heavylifting code about managing states when asking user for camera permission. Refer to demo apps to see how it is used.
- BlinkID now depends on appcompat-v7 library, instead of full android-support library.
	- even older versions of BlinkID required only features from appcompat-v7 so we now decided to make appcompat-v7 as dependency because it is much smaller than full support library and is also default dependency of all new Android apps.
- added support for scanning front side of Malaysian MyKad documents
- completely rewritten JNI bridge between Java and native code
	- this caused almost 3x increase in recognition performance in our internal tests
- fixed camera orientation bug on Nexus 5X
- DirectAPI no longer recycles Bitmap after performing recognition of it
	- this now gives you the possibility to reuse the Bitmap after it has been recognised
- **IMPORTANT** - `onScanningDone` callback method does not automatically pause scanning loop anymore. As soon as `onScanningDone` method ends, scanning will be automatically resumed without resetting state
	- if you need to reset state, please call `resetRecognitionState` in your implementation of `onScanningDone`
	- if you need to have scanning paused after `onScanningDone` ends, please call `pauseScanning` in your implementation of `onScanningDone`. Do not forget to call `resumeScanning` to resume scanning after it has been paused.
- `pauseScanning` and `resumeScanning` calls are now counted, i.e. if you call `pauseScanning` twice, you will also need to call `resumeScanning` twice to actually resume scanning
	- this is practical if you show multiple onboarding views over camera and you want the scanning paused while each is shown and you do not know in which order they will be dismissed. Now you can simply call `pauseScanning` on showing the onboarding view and `resumeScanning` on dismissing it, regardless of how many onboarding views you have
	- if you want to show onboarding help first time your scan activity starts, you can call `setInitialScanningPaused(true)` which will ensure that first time camera is started, the scanning will not automatically start - you will need to call `resumeScanning` to start scanning after your onboarding view is dismissed
- added support for `x86_64` architecture

## 1.9.0
- fixed autofocus issue on devices that do not support continuous autofocus
- improved performance and quality of United Kingdom's Driver's Licence scanning
- improved OCR quality when scanning documents with machine readable zone
- support for defining camera video resolution preset
	- to define video resolution preset via Intent, use `BlinkOCRActivity.EXTRAS_CAMERA_VIDEO_PRESET`

- fixed freeze when camera was being quickly turned on and off
- ensured `RecognizerView` lifecycle methods are called on UI thread
- ensure `onCameraPreviewStarted` is not called if camera is immediately closed after start before the call should have taken place
- ensure `onScanningDone` is not called after `RecognizerView` has been paused, even if it had result ready just before pausing
- added support for using _BlinkID_ as camera capture API. To do that, implement following:
	- when using `RecognizerView` do not call `setRecognitionSettings` or call it with `null` or empty array
	- implement `ImageListener` interface and set the listener with `setImageListener`
	- as a reminder - you can process video frames obtained that way using DirectAPI method `recognizeImageWithSettings`
- added `BlinkIDDemoCustomSegmentScan ` demo app that demonstrates advanced integration of SegmentScan feature within custom scan activity. It also demonstrates how to perform generic OCR of full camera frame, how to draw OCR results on screen and how to obtain OcrResult object for further processing.
- all demo apps now use Maven integration method because it is much easier than importing AAR manually

## 1.7.1
- fixed NullPointerException when RecognizerSettings array element was `null`
- fixed black rectangle bug on some devices

## 1.7.0
- utilize Camera2 API on devices that support it to achieve much better frame grabbing performance
- new algorithm for determining which video frame is of good enough quality to be processed - it uses much less memory than last one and works in separate thread so it does not impact image recognition thread
	- this results in much better and faster scanning performance
- support for [defining camera metering areas](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/BaseCameraView.html#setMeteringAreas(com.microblink.geometry.Rectangle[])) that will camera use to perform focus, exposure and white balance measurement.
- support for obtaining raw MRZ text even if our internal parser fails to parse it
	- in order to do that, you must [enable returning of unparsed MRTD results](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognizerSettings.html#setAllowUnparsedResults(boolean))
	- when obtaining [MRTD recognition result](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognitionResult.html), you should check if [MRZ was parsed](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognitionResult.html#isMRZParsed())
		- if MRZ was parsed, you can obtain parsed data as ususal
		- if MRZ was not parsed, you can obtain [raw OCR result](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognitionResult.html#getOcrResult()) and parse it yourself
- added support for Visa MRZ format in internal MRZ parser
- support for obtaining image of [MRZ zone](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognizerSettings.html#setShowMRZ(boolean)) and [full document image](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognizerSettings.html#setShowFullDocument(boolean)) via [ImageListener](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/image/ImageListener.html)
- bitmaps can now be processed while [RecognizerView](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html) is active using method [recognizeBitmap](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html#recognizeBitmap(android.graphics.Bitmap, com.microblink.hardware.orientation.Orientation, com.microblink.view.recognition.ScanResultListener))
- removed method `resumeScanningWithoutStateReset` - method [resumeScanning](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html#resumeScanning(boolean)) of [RecognizerView](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html) now receives `boolean` indicating whether internal state should be reset
- by default, null quiet zone is now set to `true` in US Driver's License recognizer

## 1.6.0
- removed support for ARMv5 and ARMv6 processors (armeabi) because of their very poor scanning performance
- optimized MRZ text extraction algorithm - 0-O confusion now does not cause extremely long processing that resulted in freezing the device
