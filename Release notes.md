- `EUDLRecognizer` can return face image from the driver's license
- warning for time limited license keys when using provided activities, custom UI integration or Direct API:
    - the goal is to prevent unintentional publishing of application to production with the demo license key that will expire
    - warning toast can be disabled by using `EXTRAS_SHOW_TIME_LIMITED_LICENSE_KEY_WARNING` intent extra, `RecognizerView.setLicenseKeyTimeLimitedWarningEnabled` method when custom UI integration is used and `Recognizer.setLicenseKeyTimeLimitedWarningEnabled` method when Direct API is used
  
### Minor API changes:

- `DocumentSpecification` does not have method `setPhysicalSizeInInches` any more
- `DocumentDetectorResult` does not contain information about screen orientation any more
- `QuadDetectorWithSizeResult` is renamed to `QuadWithSizeDetectorResult`

### Improvements for existing features:

- improved face detection in `DocumentFaceRecognizer`: stable detection is required to prevent returning of blurred images
- improved reading of Malaysian `MyKad` documents:
    - improved reading and parsing of address fields: previously recognizer was unable to read some documents because of the expected address format
- improved reading of Malaysian visas and work permits
- better reading of dates on Australian Driver's Licence

### Bug fixes:

- fixed crash in `GermanIDBackSideRecognitionResult` caused by ProGuard obfuscation, when it is not declared in ProGuard rules to keep the result constructor

## 3.11.0

### New features:

- added support for scanning front and back side of Swiss ID - use `SwissIDFrontSideRecognizerSettings` and `SwissIDBackSideRecognizerSettings` â€‹
- added support for reading front side of new Australian Driver's licence for state Victoria - use `AustralianDLFrontSideRecognizerSettings`

    - determines whether document should be processed or it is filtered out, based on its MRZ (Machine Readable Zone)
 - added `QuadDetectorWithSizeResult` which inherits existing `QuadDetectorResult`:
    - it's subclasses are `DocumentDetectorResult` and `MRTDDetectorResult`
    - returns information about physical size (height) in inches of the detected location when physical size is known
- introduced `GlareDetector` which is by default used in all recognizers whose settings implement `GlareDetectorOptions`:
    - when glare is detected, OCR will not be performed on the affected document position to prevent errors in the extracted data
    - if the glare detector is used and obtaining of glare metadata is enabled in `MetadataSettings`, glare status will be reported to `MetadataListener`
    - glare detector can be disabled by using `setDetectGlare(boolean)` method on the recognizer settings
  
### Minor API changes:

- `BlinkOCRRecognizerSettings` is now deprecated and will be removed in `v4.0.0`
	- use `DetectorRecognizerSettings` to perform scanning of templated documents 
	- use `BlinkInputRecognizerSettings` for segment scan or for full-screen OCR 
	- until `v4.0.0`, `BlinkOCRRecognizerSettings` will behave as before, however you are encouraged to update your code not to use it anymore
- `DocumentClassifier` interface is moved from `com.microblink.recognizers.blinkocr` to `com.microblink.recognizers.detector` package and `DocumentClassifier.classifyDocument()` now accepts `DetectorRecognitionResult` as parameter for document classification

	- this affects both _MRTD Recognizer_ (represented by `MRTDRecognizerSettings`) and _MRTD Detector_ (represented by `MRTDDetectorSettings`)
 

## 3.9.0

- bugfix in Croatian ID scanning:
    - ensured that OIB number is not returned for old ID cards, where it does not exist
- added Czech and Slovak translations
- Date fields in recognition results are returned as `com.microblink.results.date.Date` class which represents immutable dates that are consisted of day, month and year
- improved `IbanParser`:
    - improved extraction of IBANs without prefix and introduced `setAlwaysReturnPrefix` option to always return prefix (country code)
    - added support for french IBANs
- enabled reading of Pdf417 barcodes having width/height bar aspect ratio less than 2:1
- Added `VinRecognizer` for scanning VIN (*Vehicle Identification Number*) barcodes
- Added unified `BarcodeRecognizer` for scanning various tipes of barcodes
    - `ZXingRecognizer`, `BarDecoderRecognizer` and `AztecRecognizer` are **deprecated**, `BarcodeRecognizer` should be used for all barcode types that are supported by these recognizers
- `OcrLine.getChars()` method returns `CharWithVariants` array. OCR char is defined by all its parameters (value, font, position, quality, etc.) and for each resulting char it is possible to have multiple variants. For example it is possible to have same char value with different font.
- Fixed bug in SegmentScanActivity:
    - scan results are no longer hidden on shake event
- improved `IKadRecognizer`:
    - added support for long addresses and employer names
    - fixed returning of full document images as metadata
- improved `Singapore ID Recognizers`:
    - tuned reading positions

- For `Austrian ID Recognizers` added options to disable/enable extraction of certain fields in recognizer settings

## 3.8.1

- improved `CombinedRecognizers`:
    - better handling of names containing dashes and extra long names
- improved `TopUpParser`:
    - added option to return USSD code without prefix
- by default `MRTDRecognizer` does not return results with incorrect check digits

## 3.8.0

- introduced ability to create minimum-size AAR
	- a separate static library distribution now exists which contains a script that you can configure with features you need and it creates a AAR file which only contains features you need - this includes minimum-size native binary and only required assets. The rest (resources and java classes) can be thrown-away by ProGuard.
- `LibBlinkID` is now fully ProGuard-compatible, i.e. you no longer need to exclude `com.microblink.**` classes in your ProGuard configuration
- removed support for Android 2.3 and Android 4.0 - minimum required Android version is now Android 4.1 (API level 16)
	- devices with Android 4.0 and earlier take [less than 2% of market share](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html#Platform) and is very costly to support them
- removed `isItalic` and `isBold` getters from `OcrChar` class
    - they always returned `false`, since OCR engine cannot accurately detect that
- removed `setLineGroupingEnabled` and `isLineGroupingEnabled` from `BlinkOCREngineOptions` because disabling line grouping completely destroyed the OCR accuracy
- added `GermanIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the German ID

## 3.7.1

    - `CameraViewGroup`: renamed animateRotation to `mb_animateRotation`, animationDuration to `mb_animationDuration`, rotatable to `mb_rotatable`
    - `BaseCameraView`:  renamed initialOrientation to `mb_initialOrientation`, aspectMode to `mb_aspectMode`
- improved `MRTDRecognizer`:
    - WSA (World Goverment of World Citizens) added as valid country code when parsing MRZ
- added `USDLCombinedRecognizer`: scans face image and USDL barcode

## 3.7.0

- updated German ID recognizers:
    - instead of `GermanIDMRZSideRecognizer`, which was used for scanning front side of the older ID cards and back side of the new ID cards, there are two specialised recognizers:  `GermanIDBackSideRecognizer`  and `GermanOldIDRecognizer`
    - improved scanning accuracy of the `GermanIDFrontSideRecognizer` (name and surname)
    - splitting address from back side of the new German ID (GermanIDBackSideRecognizer) to ZIP code, city, street and house number

- better support for German passports: `GermanPassportRecognizer` reads passport data from MRZ and fields outside of the MRZ 

- splitting address in `MyKadRecognizer` to street, ZIP code, city and state

- improved Croatian ID recognizers:
    - multiple scans are used for better confidence

- `TopUpParser` improvements

    - `CroatianIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Croatian ID
    - `CzechIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Czech ID
    - `MRTDCombinedRecognizer`: scans face image from any type of the document and Machine Readable Zone

    - `SingaporeIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Singapore ID
    - `SlovakIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Slovak ID
    - `SlovenianIDCombinedRecognizer`: scans front and back side of the Slovenian ID

    Combined recognizers can be used for scanning multiple parts/sides of the document in predefined order. They combine results from individual scans to boost accuracy and merge them into the final result.

- added `VerificationFlowActivity` which is designed for scanning multiple parts/sides of the document by using provided combined recognizers

- optimised native binary size
    - 15% size reduction for `arm64-v8a` ABI
    - 14% size reduction for `x86` ABI

- added Belgian account number check to IBAN parser
- added support for Android 7 multi-window mode
- fixed autofocus bug on Huawei Honor 8
- fixed black camera on Motorola Moto Z
- made camera focusing more stable on some devices
    - _stable_ means less "jumpy" when searching for focused image
- added support for receiving of `GlareMetadata` which informs user that there is too much glare for performing recognition of ID document

## 3.3.0

- removed `RecognizerView` method `setInitialScanningPaused`. For achieving the same functionality, method `pauseScanning` should be used.
- added support for scanning IBANs that contain spaces and dashes

## 2.6.0
- added support for templating API
	- templating API gives you possiblity to combine various detectors with parsers and thus create your own recognizer that can recognize any type of document
	- check updated `BlinkID` demo app for example of how templating API could be used to scan both front and rear side of croatian ID cards
- updated `BlinkOCRActivity`:
	- `ScanConfiguration` can now define following new features: 
		- whether this configuration is required or optional

- added support for scanning North Carolina driver license barcodes
- added support for following MRZ codes:
	- austrian ID
	- kuwait ID
	- pakistani ID

- support for scanning custom camera frames via DirectAPI
- added support for scanning german driver licences
    - this is achieved by renaming UKDL recognizer to EUDL recognizer which now supports
      both UK driver's licences and german driver's licences
    - this recognizer will be expanded in future with support for other DL's from European contries
- fixed bug on some devices causing it to never start scanning if device was not shaken
- increased OCR engine initialisation speed

## 2.1.0
- added Detector Recognizer which gives you ability to use one of provided detectors to obtain location of object in camera frame or in image
- improved performance of conversion of [Image](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/image/Image.html) object into Bitmap

- setMeteringAreas now receives boolean indicating whether set areas should be rotated with device
- added support for specifying camera aspect mode from XML


## 2.0.0
- new API which is easier to understand, but is not backward compatible. Please check [README](README.md) and updated demo applications for more information.
- removed support for ARMv7 devices which do not support NEON SIMD
	- this enabled us to increase recognition speed at cost of not supporting old devices like those using NVIDIA Tegra 2
	- you can check [this article](https://microblink.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206113151-Removing-support-for-devices-without-NEON-SIMD-extensions) for more information about NEON and why we use it
- added official support for Android 6.0 and it's runtime camera permissions
	- if using provided activities, the logic behind asking user to give camera permission is handled internally
	- if integrating using custom UI, you are required to ask user to give you permission to use camera. To make this easier, we have provided a _CameraPermissionManager_ class which does all heavylifting code about managing states when asking user for camera permission. Refer to demo apps to see how it is used.
- BlinkID now depends on appcompat-v7 library, instead of full android-support library.
	- even older versions of BlinkID required only features from appcompat-v7 so we now decided to make appcompat-v7 as dependency because it is much smaller than full support library and is also default dependency of all new Android apps.
- added support for scanning front side of Malaysian MyKad documents
- completely rewritten JNI bridge between Java and native code
	- this caused almost 3x increase in recognition performance in our internal tests
- fixed camera orientation bug on Nexus 5X
- DirectAPI no longer recycles Bitmap after performing recognition of it
	- this now gives you the possibility to reuse the Bitmap after it has been recognised
- **IMPORTANT** - `onScanningDone` callback method does not automatically pause scanning loop anymore. As soon as `onScanningDone` method ends, scanning will be automatically resumed without resetting state
	- if you need to reset state, please call `resetRecognitionState` in your implementation of `onScanningDone`
	- if you need to have scanning paused after `onScanningDone` ends, please call `pauseScanning` in your implementation of `onScanningDone`. Do not forget to call `resumeScanning` to resume scanning after it has been paused.
- `pauseScanning` and `resumeScanning` calls are now counted, i.e. if you call `pauseScanning` twice, you will also need to call `resumeScanning` twice to actually resume scanning
	- this is practical if you show multiple onboarding views over camera and you want the scanning paused while each is shown and you do not know in which order they will be dismissed. Now you can simply call `pauseScanning` on showing the onboarding view and `resumeScanning` on dismissing it, regardless of how many onboarding views you have
	- if you want to show onboarding help first time your scan activity starts, you can call `setInitialScanningPaused(true)` which will ensure that first time camera is started, the scanning will not automatically start - you will need to call `resumeScanning` to start scanning after your onboarding view is dismissed
- added support for `x86_64` architecture

## 1.9.0
- fixed autofocus issue on devices that do not support continuous autofocus
- improved performance and quality of United Kingdom's Driver's Licence scanning
- improved OCR quality when scanning documents with machine readable zone
- support for defining camera video resolution preset
	- to define video resolution preset via Intent, use `BlinkOCRActivity.EXTRAS_CAMERA_VIDEO_PRESET`
	- to define video resolution preset on `RecognizerView`, use method `setVideoResolutionPreset`


## 1.8.0
- added support for scanning barcodes with _BlinkID_
- added support for performing raw OCR with _BlinkID_
- improved USDL barcode parsing
	- better handling of FullName, FullAddress, Height and Weight of cardholder

- fixed bug that caused returning scan result from old video frame
- fixed `NullPointerException` in camera2 management
- fixed rare race condition in gesture recognizer
- fixed segmentation fault on recognizer reconfiguration operation
- fixed freeze when camera was being quickly turned on and off
- ensured `RecognizerView` lifecycle methods are called on UI thread
- ensure `onCameraPreviewStarted` is not called if camera is immediately closed after start before the call should have taken place
- ensure `onScanningDone` is not called after `RecognizerView` has been paused, even if it had result ready just before pausing
- added support for using _BlinkID_ as camera capture API. To do that, implement following:
	- when using `RecognizerView` do not call `setRecognitionSettings` or call it with `null` or empty array
	- implement `ImageListener` interface and set the listener with `setImageListener`
	- as a reminder - you can process video frames obtained that way using DirectAPI method `recognizeImageWithSettings`
- added `BlinkIDDemoCustomSegmentScan ` demo app that demonstrates advanced integration of SegmentScan feature within custom scan activity. It also demonstrates how to perform generic OCR of full camera frame, how to draw OCR results on screen and how to obtain OcrResult object for further processing.
- all demo apps now use Maven integration method because it is much easier than importing AAR manually

## 1.7.1
- fixed NullPointerException when RecognizerSettings array element was `null`
- fixed black rectangle bug on some devices

## 1.7.0
- utilize Camera2 API on devices that support it to achieve much better frame grabbing performance
- new algorithm for determining which video frame is of good enough quality to be processed - it uses much less memory than last one and works in separate thread so it does not impact image recognition thread
	- this results in much better and faster scanning performance
- support for [defining camera metering areas](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/BaseCameraView.html#setMeteringAreas(com.microblink.geometry.Rectangle[])) that will camera use to perform focus, exposure and white balance measurement.
- support for obtaining raw MRZ text even if our internal parser fails to parse it
	- in order to do that, you must [enable returning of unparsed MRTD results](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognizerSettings.html#setAllowUnparsedResults(boolean))
	- when obtaining [MRTD recognition result](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognitionResult.html), you should check if [MRZ was parsed](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognitionResult.html#isMRZParsed())
		- if MRZ was parsed, you can obtain parsed data as ususal
		- if MRZ was not parsed, you can obtain [raw OCR result](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognitionResult.html#getOcrResult()) and parse it yourself
- added support for Visa MRZ format in internal MRZ parser
- support for obtaining image of [MRZ zone](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognizerSettings.html#setShowMRZ(boolean)) and [full document image](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognizerSettings.html#setShowFullDocument(boolean)) via [ImageListener](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/image/ImageListener.html)
- bitmaps can now be processed while [RecognizerView](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html) is active using method [recognizeBitmap](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html#recognizeBitmap(android.graphics.Bitmap, com.microblink.hardware.orientation.Orientation, com.microblink.view.recognition.ScanResultListener))
- removed method `resumeScanningWithoutStateReset` - method [resumeScanning](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html#resumeScanning(boolean)) of [RecognizerView](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html) now receives `boolean` indicating whether internal state should be reset
- by default, null quiet zone is now set to `true` in US Driver's License recognizer

## 1.6.0
- removed support for ARMv5 and ARMv6 processors (armeabi) because of their very poor scanning performance
- optimized MRZ text extraction algorithm - 0-O confusion now does not cause extremely long processing that resulted in freezing the device
- updated documentation with use cases for which BlinkID is applicable
- fixed crash in DirectAPI when recognizer was terminated in the middle of recognition process

## 1.5.0
- support for defining camera aspect mode via intent
- removed autoscale setting from USDL recognizer - autoscale is now always used
